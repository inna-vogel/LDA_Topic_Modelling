# LDA_Topic_Modelling
Topic Modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA

LDA is an unsupervised generative model that assigns topic distributions to documents.
The model assumes that each document contains more than one topic. The topics are assigned to the documents depending on the words in each document which contribute to each topic. The number of topics in the corpus must be specified a priori. So there must be raughly an idea of the topics in the data set. Several topics may share the same words.
